# CTF-Project
#I have done this CTF project whole heartedly and I am looking forward very eagerly to join CTF. 
#I am very well aware that I should do REACT.js software for my portfolio. I looked into internet and they suggested me to study html,css and javascript first before I get hands on React.js.Unfortunately I couldnt finish my portfolio using React.js and I did it using html and css.With few more days I will be able to learn React.js and I will definitely meet the requirements.It's my fault not finishing on time but I was very dedicated while studying for this project.I guess I need a bit of more time to complete the task.If the oppurtunity given I will develop my skills in the particular field and will be a good source to your project. I have passion to learn and do more tasks.Initially I had no idea about CTF but now with my peer support I really want to join CTF and learn lot of new things and I am very much interested to be in part of CTF.
